## Project Title : ML 21/22 28 Improve Unit Test Spatial Pooler
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Project Description**
========================

Spatial Pooler (SP) is a learning algorithm that is designed to replicate the neuron functionality of the human brain. Essentially, if a brain sees one thing multiple times, it is going to strengthen the synapses that react to the specific input resulting in the recognition of the object. Similarly, if several similar SDRs are presented to the SP algorithm, it will reinforce the columns that are active according to the on bits in the SDRs. If the number of training iterations is big enough, the SP will be able to identify the objects by producing different sets of active columns within the specified size of SDR for different objects.
