## Sprints
On 24 of November group branch on github created. 
for the first & Second time_slots of project, we did not have that much progress due to the Christmas holidays. 
Besides, we are almost naive in the telecommunication field, so our progress was low and had to reread some functions or structures to get the point. 
But overall after our research and finding the reasons behind generating this new wireless communication really get motivated to dive deeper into it.


On 17.01.2023 means the 3rd Sprint we somehow rap up the searchs about the functions and descriptions and started to move toward the implimentation.


Till 24.01.2023 we tried to install open 5gs on Virtual Machine which we faced numerous problems and stopeed further configuration till that time.

# Overview of 5G Network
## Descriptions

Traditional Cellular Network operates in the principle of protocols not on the principle of Data & Intelligence.






#### What is 5G?
The fifth generation of wireless network technology is known as 5G.

5G is the fifth generation of mobile networks that provides:

* faster
* more reliable 
* efficient connectivity 

for a wide range of devices and services. 


Compared to its predecessor (4G), 5G offers:

* lower latency
* higher bandwidth
* increased capacity 


To support the growing demand for data-intensive applications such as:
* virtual and augmented reality
* the Internet of Things (IoT) and
* cloud computing






#### Why 5G?
Since I am not obtaining the data rate which I need to receive in, which is 1 Gbit/s for current 4G.
4G provides throughput of 50 Mbps but 5G is able to provide 1Gbps or more but capable of providing 10Gbps.
Besides, the capacity of 4G has already reached its limit, 5G is being sought after.




Because cloud platforms at the edge will run near to where services and applications need them, energy efficiency is anticipated as an advantage of 5G. 
lowering the necessary user equipment & computational power, That allows the gadget to conserve energy and battery life.



#### What is 5G-SA (stand alone) system?
5G-SA (Stand Alone) is a type of 5G (fifth generation) wireless communication system that operates independently, without relying on any previous generation networks such as 4G LTE. 
5G-SA systems use a new core network architecture, known as the 5G Non-Standalone (NSA) architecture, which includes new features such as increased network speed, reduced latency, and improved network capacity. 
The goal of 5G-SA is to provide a completely new and enhanced mobile communication experience, including faster data speeds and more reliable connections, for users. It also enables a range of new use cases, such as autonomous vehicles, remote surgery, and virtual and augmented reality applications, that were not possible with previous generation networks.



#### what is edge computing in 5G?
Edge computing in 5G is a distributed computing architecture where data processing and storage take place at the edge of a network, closer to the end-user, instead of being centralized in a data center or the cloud. 
This enables 
* low-latency
* real-time processing of data 
* reducing the dependence on remote data centers
* improving the responsiveness of applications and services.


In 5G networks, edge computing can be used to handle the massive amounts of data generated by connected devices, providing more efficient and scalable solutions for data processing and analysis. This can help to support the development of new and innovative applications and services, such as autonomous vehicles, virtual and augmented reality, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Overall, edge computing in 5G enhances the capabilities of the network, providing a more agile and responsive computing environment for the deployment of new services and applications.






#### This technology is allowing breakthroughs in:

* Autonomous driving
* Cloud gaming
* AR/VR    



According to the 3GPP the 5G System(5GS) will have three main components 
1) User Equipment(UE)
2) 5G Radio Access Network(5G-RAN)     ;A RAN wirelessly connects user equipment to a core network.
3) 5G Core Network (5GC) ;5G Core network facilitate various Network Functions such as session management, authentication, policy control, data storage etc.

##### Responsibilities of 5G core networks are:
*  Mobility Management
*  Subscription Management
*  security management
  
 
The rest of the 5G core network communicate with each other has Micro services.
So there is no need to focus on an explicit point to point interfaces between them.

One of the characteristics of 5G is ultrareliability (for example, in a surgery performed by a robot, network downtime is not acceptable and may even result in death) and low latency ( It is very difficult to perform a surgery when a Robot has a huge lag from the controling Point).


For 5G architecture we have 2 architectures service Based architecture and Core to Core architecture.






One of the primary benefits of deploying the 5G Core is network slicing.


Till now businesses only relied on one shared public network. 


Network slicing combines the coverage and convenience of a public network with the perfomance and security of a stand alone private network.
to deliver superlevel of flexibility and speed. 




#### What is network slicing?

It is an attempt starting from 4G, But finally in 5G it happened. 
the operators' best response, Network slicing, is for building and managing a network that meets even above the growing needs of a diverse set of users. 
A sliced network is created by transforming it into a collection of logical networks that sit on top of a shared infrastructure. 
Each logical network is built for a specific business purpose and includes all of the necessary network resources that are configured and linked end-to-end. 
The network slice is a logically divided, self-contained, autonomous, and secure section of the network that targets distinct services with varying speed, latency, and reliability needs.
For a crucial IoT use case, network slice qualities include low latency, high bandwidth, and ultra-reliability and
for a massive IoT use case, network slice characteristics include higher latency and lower bandwidth.







#### What is 5G RAN?
5G is mostly about connecting everything and allowing new use cases. 
To enable these fantastic applications, a 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) leverages 5G radio FDD frequencies to provide wireless access to devices.
5G RAN is the most recent wireless communication architecture that leverages 5G radio frequencies to deliver wireless connection to devices. 
A radio access network (RAN) is a critical component of a mobile telecommunications system that uses a radio connection to connect devices such as smartphones to a network. 
This is accomplished by transforming voice and data into digital signals and sending them as radio waves to RAN transceivers, which then route them to the core network. Data can be transmitted to the internet from the core network. RANs carry out intensive, sophisticated processing.




#### Why 5G RAN is Important?
Today's 5G is the product of years of RAN development. Because it integrates cutting-edge technical advances in 5G new radio air interface and 5G next-generation core network designs, the technology is substantially more sophisticated than 3G and 4G networks. As a consequence, fast, low-latency, high-bandwidth 5G RANs with exceptional performance, efficiency, and affordability can link everything, anyplace. 





#### RAN (GNB): 
Radio Access Network which in the 5G world is known as GNB. it is connected to the UE & It is connected to the 5G core.




#### What is OpenAirInterface (OAI)?
OpenAirInterface (OAI) is an open-source software platform for the implementation and experimentation of wireless cellular networks. 
It provides a flexible and configurable environment for research, development, and testing of wireless communication systems and protocols. 
The platform is designed to support multiple access technologies, such as LTE, 5G NR, Wi-Fi, and others. 
The OAI community aims to advance the state of the art in wireless communication research and to provide an open and collaborative environment for researchers, developers, and industry partners.




#### PDN:
PDN stands for Packet Data Network in 5G technology. 
It is a network infrastructure that provides connectivity for data transmission over IP packets. 
It enables 5G devices to access the internet and other IP-based networks.




#### EPC:
EPC stands for Evolved Packet Core in 5G technology. It is the core network infrastructure that provides end-to-end connectivity and routing for data transmission in 5G networks. The EPC consists of several network elements, including the Mobility Management Entity (MME), Serving Gateway (S-GW), and Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN-GW), that work together to manage and route data packets efficiently and securely. The EPC is designed to support the high-speed, low-latency, and large-scale data transmission requirements of 5G networks.




#### OAI UE / RAN:
OpenAirInterface (OAI) User Equipment (UE) and Radio Access Network (RAN) are two main components of the OAI platform.

The OAI UE represents a wireless device in a cellular network, such as a smartphone, tablet, or laptop. 

It implements the protocols and procedures for communication with the network and provides support for various types of data and voice services.

The OAI RAN represents the network side of the cellular system, including the base stations and core network elements that provide the connectivity and services to the UE. 
It implements the air interface protocols and procedures for communication with the UE and provides support for various types of radio access technologies, such as LTE and 5G NR.

Together, the OAI UE and RAN components provide a complete environment for the experimentation and testing of wireless communication systems and protocols.





#### What is APN in 5G?
An Access Point Name (APN) is a configuration setting in a mobile device used to access a mobile data network. 
An APN defines the network path for all mobile data transactions.

When a mobile device is connected to a cellular network, the APN setting is used to determine which gateway the device should use to access the internet. 
Different APN configurations can be used to support different types of data services, such as internet browsing, MMS messaging, or private network access.

APN settings typically include information such as the name of the APN, the IP address of the gateway, and the user name and password for authentication. 
APN settings are provisioned by the mobile network operator and are usually automatically configured on the device when it is activated. 
However, in some cases, the APN settings may need to be manually configured by the user.



#### What is DNN in 5G?
DNN stands for Deep Neural Network and it is a type of artificial neural network with multiple layers of interconnected nodes. 
In the context of 5G, DNNs can be used for various tasks such as network management, network optimization, and enhanced mobile broadband. 
DNNs can analyze large amounts of data generated by 5G networks to make predictions and decisions, leading to more efficient and intelligent network operations.



#### What is OGSTUN?
OGSTUN (OpenGGSN TUNnel) is a TUNnel interface of a Packet Data Network (PDN) in the context of the OpenGGSN open-source Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) software. The GGSN is an essential component in a cellular network that provides IP connectivity to mobile devices for data services.

OGSTUN provides a Tunnel interface for the PDN to the GGSN. This allows the GGSN to tunnel IP packets between the PDN and the mobile device over the cellular network. The Tunnel interface acts as a virtual interface that encapsulates IP packets in a specific format, allowing them to be transmitted over the cellular network as a single unit. The Tunnel interface also provides a mechanism for the GGSN to route IP packets between the PDN and the mobile device, based on the address information in the packets.

In summary, OGSTUN is a Tunnel interface used in the OpenGGSN software to provide IP connectivity to mobile devices over a cellular network.




#### What is NRF?
NRF stands for Network Resource Function, which is a component in 5G architecture that manages network resources such as computing, storage, and bandwidth. 
The NRF is responsible for allocating these resources to meet the demands of 5G services and applications, thus enabling the efficient and effective delivery of 5G services to end-users.



#### what is PCF?
PCF stands for Policy Control Function, which is a component in 5G architecture that determines how network resources are used and controls access to these resources based on policies set by the network operator. 
The PCF is responsible for making real-time decisions on how network resources are allocated to different services and applications, ensuring that the network operates efficiently and effectively while also protecting against unauthorized access and usage. 
This function is critical in 5G networks, as it helps to ensure that network resources are used optimally and that network performance is not impacted by malicious or unintended activity.


#### what is TAC/TAI in 5G?

TAC (Timing Advance Command) and TAI (Timing Advance Indicator) are related concepts in 5G mobile communications.

TAC is a control message sent from the network to the user equipment (UE) to indicate the timing advance required for the UE to synchronize its transmission with the network. The TAC message contains a value that represents the timing advance required to synchronize the transmission of the UE with the network.

TAI, on the other hand, is a combination of the Tracking Area Code (TAC) and the cell identity of the cell with which the UE is communicating. The TAI is used by the network to determine the location of the UE and to route incoming data to the correct cell.

In 5G, the TAC and TAI are used to synchronize the transmission of the UE with the network, allowing for efficient and effective delivery of 5G services to the end-user.

### what is SST and SD?

* SST indicates Slice Service Type which is a mandatory item.
* SD indicates a kind of slice ID within the SST which is an option item. This is used to indicates a specific slices in case where there are one or more slices are supported in the same SST. [Source](https://www.sharetechnote.com/html/5G/5G_NetworkSlicing.html#:~:text=SST%20indicates%20Slice%20Service%20Type,supported%20in%20the%20same%20SST.)




SST stands for "Split Subframe Template". 

In 5G, the subframe structure in the time domain has been split into two parts, known as SST-0 and SST-1. 

This split is used to allocate different resources for control and data channels in the subframe, providing greater flexibility and efficiency in resource allocation.

SD, on the other hand, stands for "Service Discovery". 

In 5G networks, Service Discovery refers to the process of discovering and identifying available services, such as network services or applications, in a 5G network.

Service Discovery is important for enabling seamless connectivity and efficient communication between devices in a 5G network.

Both SST and SD play critical roles in ensuring the efficient and reliable operation of 5G networks.

# Configuration

I considered 2 Different senarios. by using Cloud or Virtual machine.


## The Practical works procedure using Cloud(Amazon AWS)

1) first I installed the ubuntu on an EC2 instance of AWS.

with this minimul requirements: 
* CPU type: x86-64 (specific model and number of cores only affect performance)
* RAM: 4 GB
* Disk space: 40 GB
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS


2) I used the below command for connecting from my laptop to this Ubuntu system hosted on the Cloud.

The ssh command for connecting from my windows machine to the SSH Server AWS instance:


ssh -i "MyFirst.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-121-232-36.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com


To test the Internet connection between the User equipment & the Internet:


1) First access the User Equipment container by:

 docker exec -ti ue bash 
 
 
 
2) Then, List the network interfaces by:

ifconfig



3)  Now chech if there is a connection to the interent by using the IP Address of one of the User Equipments:

ping google.com -I 10.45.0.4

## The Practical works procedure on Virtual Box

## Requirements
####  * Software:
1) Virtual Box
2) OS: Ubuntu 18.04 or later versions
3) [open5gs- Release-16](https://open5gs.org/)

####  * Hardware:
1) Laptop
2) Intel i7-1165G7
3) 8GB RAM



1) Installing Virtual Box (Oracle VM VirtualBox 6.1 used in this project)
2) Installing Ubuntu (Virtual machine) (ubuntu-22.04.1-desktop-amd64 used in this project)
3) installing [open5gs](https://open5gs.org/) (which is an open Library) on this Ubuntu
Installing [open5gs on Ubuntu](https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/guide/01-quickstart/#:~:text=system%20boot)
 to download open5gs code just follow the link to [github](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs) and clone the code. then install it on the virtual machine.
 
 To check if we have installed open5gs correctly we can use this command:
 
 sudo service open5gs-mmed status     ; instead of mmed u can write the name of any services that u want like: amfd
 
 or by writing:       sudo systemctl status open5gs*                      :which shows all the active functions
 
 
 
 
4) Installing [UERANSIM](https://www.free5gc.org/installations/stage-3-sim-install/) on different virtual machine in the same Virtual Box so both UERANSIM and free5gs core can communicate with each other.




To check if the Open5GS is installed and works:


sudo service open5gs-amfd status

or 

Systemctl status open5gs*                   




## Comparing the cloud and Virtual Box
Using Cloud was extremely easier and faster compare to using the Virtual Box. However because I needed to install the Ubuntu with at leaste $GB RAM I had to pay for my machine and It is not free like using the Virtual Box.
